# DCGAN
**
Generate Cartoon Characters(Anime Character Faces) using  DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL
GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS.**

Dataset description: Anime Faces[available on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/anime-faces] - This is a dataset consisting of 21551 images of anime faces, these images are used to train descriminator and generator.
The network architecture for DCGAN described in the research paper :https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf , the similar network has been built in the above code implementation to generate images.
